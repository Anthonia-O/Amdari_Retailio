Retail Sales Analytics Pipeline (Snowflake + Airbyte + Power BI)
í³Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics pipeline built using modern data engineering tools.
Raw retail sales and product data are ingested, cleaned, transformed, and visualised in a professional Power BI dashboard to support business decision-making.

The project focuses on:

Reliable data ingestion

Clean, analytics-ready data modelling

Business-focused visualisation and insights

í·ª Data Pipeline Details
1ï¸âƒ£ Data Ingestion

Data is ingested into Snowflake using Airbyte

Tables are first landed in the RAW schema without transformation

Schema tracking is enabled to handle future changes safely

2ï¸âƒ£ Data Transformation

SQL transformations clean and standardise the data

Key transformations include:

Date parsing and formatting

Numeric type casting (Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount)

Standardised naming conventions

Final output is exposed as a BI-friendly view:

V_POWERBI_CLEAN_DATA

3ï¸âƒ£ Analytics Layer

Cleaned sales and product data are joined

Business-ready metrics are derived:

Total Sales

Total Profit

Profit Margin

Quantity Sold

Discount impact

í³ˆ Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI report is designed for executive and business users and includes:

í´¹ Executive Overview

KPI cards (Sales, Profit, Margin, Quantity)

Sales vs Profit trends over time

Regional performance comparison

í´¹ Product & Category Performance

Profitability by category and sub-category

Top and bottom performing products

Sales vs Profit comparison

í´¹ Discount & Loss Analysis

Discount vs Profit scatter analysis

Profit margin by discount bands

Identification of loss-making discount strategies

All visuals are fully interactive using slicers for:

Date

Region

Segment

Category

í» ï¸ Technologies Used

Snowflake â€“ Cloud data warehouse

Airbyte â€“ Data ingestion & orchestration

Power BI â€“ Business intelligence & visualisation

SQL â€“ Data transformation and modelling

Python â€“ Supporting scripts and utilities

íº€ How to Use This Project

Load raw data into Snowflake (via Airbyte or manual upload)

Run transformation scripts / stored procedures

Connect Power BI to the V_POWERBI_CLEAN_DATA view

Refresh visuals and explore insights

í³Œ Key Learning Outcomes
